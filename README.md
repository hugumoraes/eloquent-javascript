### Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

\####

\#####

### FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
